# Missionaries and Cannibals Problem

## Overview
The Missionaries and Cannibals Problem, is stated as followed:
* 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals are on one side of the river and wish to cross it using the boat they found
* The boat can only hold 2 people at once and needs a driver (so 1 person must always go between sides)
* The missionaries can never be outnumbered by the cannibals

## Program overview 
the program solves the Missionaries and Cannibals problem, through using breadth first search (BFS) to navigate through the 
differnt states (defined in State class) in the problem by doing the folowing 5 available actions
* move 1 cannibal, 0 missionary
* move 0 cannibal, 1 missionary
* move 2 cannibal, 0 missionary
* move 0 cannibal, 2 missionary
* move 1 cannibal, 1 missionary

these actions are stored in a const vector<pair<int,int>> (called ACTIONS, found in main.cpp) and are either subtracted (boat on left) or 
added (boat on right) to the total missionaries or cannibles

### State Class Overview 
The State class define a method of tarcking and storing info about each state that is generated by BFS ubtil there are either no solution
or a goal is reached. the following is an outline of the States structure

* important varibles
    * int missionaries - tracks the current missionary on the left side (allowing  3 - missionary to represnt missionary on right)
    * int cannibals - tracks the current cannibal on the left (allowing 3 - cannibals to represnt cannibals on right)
    * bool BoatOnLeft - true meaning boats on left, false means it's on right
    * int step - allows for tarcking toatl steps
* varibles for Output
    * State* lastState - used to track state prior, set to nullptr for inital 
* important functions
    * bool IsGoalState() - returns true if the state is the goal state meaning all missionary and cannibles are on the right side
    represnted as a State which has missionaries = 0, cannibals = 0, boatOnLeft = false (meaning it's on the right)
    * bool ValidState() - state is valid if missionaries on either side are = to 0 and missionaries >= cannibles and 
    no new missionaries or cannibles have been created

## Solution Overveiw
The inital state of Missionaries and Cannibals Problem, can be repesnt by a state class which vlaues are:
* int missionaries = 3
* int cannibals = 3
* bool BoatOnLeft = true
* int step = 0
* lastState = nullptr

This is then passed into the function taht define BFS located in Main.cpp where new states are from running throug
all the pssoible actions stored in ACTION. this will run until either all possible valid moves have been covered or
the Goal State where both missionaries and cannibals values = 0 (meaning they are all on the right) and 
BoatOnLeft = false (meaing it's on left)

### Final Notes
* when a state is created it is first check if it's valid and isn't already presnt in the gloabl value "vector<State*> states;" 
found in main.cpp, this allows for States and folowing States to not be re-examined. Ensuring that eventaully the program will
end due to running out of possible states
